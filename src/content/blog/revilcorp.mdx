## Investigating the Compromised Endpoint

**Scenario**: One of the employees at Lockman Group contacted the IT department, frustrated that all his files had been renamed with an unfamiliar file extension. The IT team quickly identified the issue as a potential ransomware attack and escalated the case to the Incident Response team for further investigation.

As the incident responder, your task is to analyze the compromised host using Redline, a powerful memory analysis tool. Let’s dive into the investigation!

---

#### **Question 1: What is the compromised employee's full name?**

To begin, load the saved memory analysis located in the `Desktop/analysis` folder. In Redline, click on **Open Previous Analysis** under the **Analyze Data** section, as shown below:
