### SITREP
Several employees reported that they were unable to log into Outlook. Additionally, the Exchange system administrator discovered that they could not access the Exchange Admin Center. Upon initial triage, they found multiple suspicious README files on the Exchange server.

Below is a copy of the ransomware note:

### Exchange Server Compromised

Below are the error messages encountered by the Exchange administrator and employees when attempting to access Exchange or Outlook.

**Task:** You have been assigned to investigate this incident. Use Splunk to answer the questions below regarding the Conti ransomware attack.

#### Question 1: Can you identify the location of the ransomware?
The hint suggests looking for a common Windows binary in an unusual location. To identify this, I launched Splunk and set the timestamp to `All time`. Among the four available sourcetypes, I selected `WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`. Searching for executable files within user directories, I found the ransomware under the Administrator's Documents folder disguised as `cmd.exe`â€”an unusual location.

Command used:
```Splunk
sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
| search Users AND image: ".exe"
```

<Collapse title="View Answer">
  <Success>C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\cmd.exe</Success>
</Collapse>

#### Question 2: What is the Sysmon event ID for the related file creation event?
The question asks for the event code associated with file creation. Sysmon logs file creation events under EventCode 11. We can confirm this by filtering events based on EventCode.

Command used:
```Splunk
sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
| search Users AND image: ".exe" AND EventCode
```

<Collapse title="View Answer">
  <Success>11</Success>
</Collapse>

#### Question 3: Can you find the MD5 hash of the ransomware?
To retrieve the MD5 hash of the ransomware executable (`cmd.exe`), we can filter for hashes in the logs.

Command used:
```Splunk
sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
| search Users AND image: "C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\cmd.exe" AND "Hashes"
```

  <Success>290c7dfb01e50cea9e19da81a781af2c</Success>
</Collapse>

#### Question 4: What file was saved to multiple folder locations?
To determine which file was saved in multiple locations, I filtered logs for EventCode 11 and used the `table` command to display only the `TargetFileName` field.

Command used:
```Splunk
EventCode=11
| table TargetFileName
```

  <Success>readme.txt</Success>
</Collapse>

#### Question 5: What command did the attacker use to add a new user to the compromised system?
To find this, I searched for Sysmon logs where the command included `/add`.

Command used:
```Splunk
sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" AND "/add"
| table _time, CommandLine
```

![added user](/ransomware/q5.PNG)

<Collapse title="View Answer">
  <Success>net user /add securityninja hardToHack123$</Success>
</Collapse>

#### Question 6: What was the migrated process image, and what was the original process image?
By filtering for EventCode 8, I identified the process migration details.

Command used:
```Splunk
sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" AND EventCode=8
```

![migrated](/ransomware/q6.PNG)

<Collapse title="View Answer">
  <Success>C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe, C:\Windows\System32\wbem\unsecapp.exe</Success>
</Collapse>

#### Question 7: What process image was used to retrieve system hashes?

From the logs, the `lsass.exe` process was used to retrieve system hashes.

![Targetimage](/ransomware/q7.PNG)

<Collapse title="View Answer">
  <Success>C:\Windows\System32\lsass.exe</Success>
</Collapse>

#### Question 8: What web shell did the exploit deploy?
The hint suggests checking IIS logs for POST requests.

Command used:
```Splunk
sourcetype="WinEventLog:Application" AND "request"
```

![exploit](/ransomware/q8.PNG)

<Collapse title="View Answer">
  <Success>i3gfPctK1c2x.aspx</Success>
</Collapse>

#### Question 9: What command executed the web shell?
To locate this, I searched for command-line executions related to `i3gfPctK1c2x.aspx`.

![command](/ransomware/q9.PNG)

<Collapse title="View Answer">
  <Success>attrib.exe -r \\win-aoqkg2as2q7.bellybear.local\C$\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\i3gfPctK1c2x.aspx</Success>
</Collapse>

#### Question 10: What three CVEs were leveraged in this exploit?

<Collapse title="View Answer">
  <Success>CVE-2020-0796, CVE-2018-13374, CVE-2018-13379</Success>
</Collapse>

#### Conclusion
In conclusion, this investigation provided a comprehensive analysis of the Conti ransomware attack on the Exchange server. By leveraging Splunk for log analysis, we identified key attack indicators, including the ransomware's location, event logs, malicious commands, and exploited vulnerabilities. Understanding these attack patterns enhances our ability to detect, mitigate, and prevent similar threats in the future.
